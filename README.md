This is just a repository to store and track development of my personal discord bot. You can do with this code what you want, but if you're gonna publish something based off of it (which is understandably very unlikely), please be sure to credit me! (:

## Usage example
Simply download the latest release (usually named ``altair.zip``) or clone this repository, then either create a ``.env`` file or set your environment variables as follows:
```
token = <your bot token>
ownerID = <id of your discord account>
prefix = a!
saucenaoAPIKey = 
youtubeAPIKey = 
```
## Issues
* Typing status is a bit wonky, after commands that execute very quickly Altair doesn't stop typing for about 5 seconds, this is probably related to rate-limits.
